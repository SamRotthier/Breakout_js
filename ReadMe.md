In this project I made a version of the popular game Breakout.
We don't use libraries, everything is in html/css/javascript.
Controls are the arrow keys (left, right and up).
After pressing the start button at the top left, you can launch a ball with the up key.

Followed tutorial: https://udemy.com/course/create-javascript-game

I deviated from the tutorial to make the code cleaner.
